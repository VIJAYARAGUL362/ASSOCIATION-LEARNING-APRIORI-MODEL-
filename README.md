# Market Basket Analysis with Apriori

This project performs market basket analysis using the Apriori algorithm to uncover associations between items frequently purchased together.  Leveraging transactional data, it identifies these relationships, providing valuable insights for optimizing product placement, personalized recommendations, targeted marketing campaigns, and inventory management.

## Introduction

Market basket analysis is a data mining technique used to discover associations between items frequently bought together.  The Apriori algorithm is a classic algorithm for this purpose, identifying frequent itemsets (combinations of items) and generating association rules that describe relationships like "If a customer buys X, they are also likely to buy Y."  This project streamlines the process, from data loading and preprocessing to rule generation and interpretation.

## Dataset

The project uses a CSV file named `Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv`. This file contains transactional data, where each row typically represents a customer transaction or order.  The columns represent individual items, and a value in a cell indicates whether that item was present in the transaction.  Common formats include:

*   **Binary:** 1 indicates the item was purchased, 0 indicates it was not.
*   **Boolean:** True/False values.
*   **Item Name:** The actual item name is present in the cell if purchased.

The dataset structure is assumed to be such that each row is a transaction, and each column is an item.  Missing values (e.g., NaN, empty strings) indicate the absence of an item in a transaction.

## Algorithm

The Apriori algorithm works in two main steps:

1.  **Frequent Itemset Generation:**  Identify itemsets that meet a minimum support threshold. Support is the proportion of transactions that contain the itemset.  Apriori uses an iterative approach, starting with single items and progressively generating larger itemsets.

2.  **Association Rule Generation:**  From the frequent itemsets, generate association rules that meet minimum confidence and lift thresholds.
    *   **Confidence:** The probability that a customer will buy item Y given they bought item X.
    *   **Lift:**  A measure of how much more likely item Y is to be bought given item X, compared to if the items were independent.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.x
*   Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
*   NumPy: For numerical operations.
*   apyori: For implementing the Apriori algorithm (install with `pip install apyori`).

## Usage

1.  Clone the repository (if applicable).
2.  Place the `Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv` file in the same directory as the Python script.
3.  Run the script:

```bash
python your_script_name.py  # Replace with the actual script name.
